# DQN-Pytorch

This contains a notebook with codes for **Value-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms**. It contains Deep Q Learning, DQN with replay buffer and target network, DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay.

Ths was done for a lab of a Deep Reinforcement Learning class given by J. Read at Ecole Polytechnique.
